some of my TODO list

- hardware encoder implementation for teensy 4.x
- inner velocity control loop with reciprocal velocity and ema-filtering
- integrate calibration code with SWS and make a routine that takes measurements every X degrees from east to west 
- experiment with the kick, hysterisis, non-linear mapping, no-ramp options and check their effects
- experiment with 36.6 KHz and 12 bit PWM frequency and resolution and dynamic PWM (Teensy 4.1 can do it and my h-bridge TC78H660FNG is specified up to 400 kHz max at 50% duty
